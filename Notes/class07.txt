***************Implicit wait***************

 Implicit wait:
 it tells the webdriver to wait for a certain amount of time before throwing an exception
 it will only be written once and will be applied to the whole session of the execution
 We can say that implicit wait is a global wait

 Implicit wait is usually set to 20 seconds. If your element is found in any time between the remaining
 time, that time will be ignored and your script will move on to the next line or action

 If the element is not found in a given time, ONLY then you will get an exception

Syntax:
driver.manage().timeouts().implicitlyWait(Duration.of.Seconds(20));
