*****************************Selenium 02**************************


1. id



2. name


3. class (classname)





precatuions:
1. what ever locator that you choose please make sure it is unqiue enough,
2. we should avoid the locstors that have digits and spaces.



In case of duplicate locator:
if in case u used a locator that had a duplicate value, selenium is going to find the first one and interact with it.

linktext:

1.the element must be in "a" tag , a tag is also called anchor tag and it usually contains links
2.the element must have some text
if one of the condition is not fullfiled u cant use the linktext locator

partial linktext:(  u can use partial text to locate elements)
1.the element must be in "a" tag , a tag is also called anchor tag and it usually contains links
2.the element must have some text
if one of the condition is not fullfiled u cant use the linktext locator



webElements commands

1.clear()----> clear the test box
2.gettext()--> get the text out of the element (if there is no text in the webelement it will return nothing)


whats the purpose of driver.findElements()?
to find multiple elements that match the condition


driver.getattribute("")--->get the value of attribute mentioned.
