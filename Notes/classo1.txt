-- get() will not keep the history of the browser whereas navigate() will

close() vs quit()
-- close() will close the current tab
-- quit() will quit the whole browser

fullscreen() vs maximize()
-- maximize() will maximize the browser and you will still be able to see url, tabs, bookmarks
    and fullscreen() will maximize the whole web application


    What is a WebElement?
    anything we see on the web page is considered to be a webelement
    e.g. buttons, textboxes, checkboxes, links

    HTML?
    HyperText Markup Language

    What is DOM?
    DOM stands for Document Object Model. It is the browser's
    internal view of the webpage.
    Also called as Developer's tools, or Dev tools
    Document --> can be stored any document as pdf, excel
    Object --> any line in HTML is considered as Object
    Model --> it is just a layout of the HTML

    Locator
    is an address or a position of an webelement on the web page
    is used to locate or identify webelements on the webpage

    8 Locators:
    - ID
    - Name
    - Tagname
    - xpath
    - linktext
    - partialLinkText
    - CSS Selector
    - ClassName


    Why do we need many locators?
    -- some locators might have duplicate values in other nodes
    -- Developers may not provide all the locators for all the elements
